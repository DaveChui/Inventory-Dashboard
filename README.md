# 📊 RetailIQ: Inventory Optimization Dashboard

> **A data-driven solution that helped reduce retail losses from KES 1.5M to 40K in 3 months**
---

## 🎯 The Problem

Retail businesses lose millions annually through:
- **Overstocking**: Capital tied up in slow-moving inventory
- **Stockouts**: Lost sales due to empty shelves  
- **Theft & Losses**: Preventable shrinkage
- **Poor Forecasting**: Reactive instead of predictive ordering

**Real Impact**: At my previous role, procedural losses exceeded KES 1.5M monthly.

## ✅ The Solution

RetailIQ provides:
- **Real-time inventory health monitoring** across 50+ SKUs
- **Predictive reorder alerts** based on demand patterns
- **Loss prevention insights** highlighting high-risk products
- **ROI calculator** showing potential savings from optimization
- **Category performance analysis** for strategic decision-making

## 💰 Business Impact

Using this system, I achieved:
- ✅ **96% reduction in procedural losses** (KES 1.5M → 40K)
- ✅ **36% improvement in stock efficiency** (4.2 weeks → 2.68 weeks cover)
- ✅ **Optimized 300+ SKUs** across multiple categories
- ✅ **Projected annual savings**: KES 2M+ for medium-sized retailers
